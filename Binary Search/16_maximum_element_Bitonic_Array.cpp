/*Monotonic means the Array elements are in increasing or decresing order(strictly).
Bitonic means Monotonically increasing and then decreasing */

/*In this problem we have to return the index of maximum element*/
 /* APPROACH : This will be the peak element and there will be only one peak element 
 in Bitonic array that peak element will be the answer*/
