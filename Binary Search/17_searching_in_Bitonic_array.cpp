/*Monotonic means the Array elements are in increasing or decresing order(strictly).
Bitonic means Monotonically increasing and then decreasing */

/*Searching in bitonic array is done by finding the peak element and than breaking the 
array into two portion 
            -Increasing array
            -Decreasing array
Then normal binary search in Sorted and reverse sorted array*/
